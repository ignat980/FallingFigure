Falling Figure game

This is a game written in ActionScript3 that teaches basic recognition of color, shape, and size.

The idea is simple:
You have falling shapes with varying properties that the user needs to put into respective buckets, i.e. A blue circle needs to go into the blue round bucket.

There are different 'gamemodes' to play, which define the type of properties the user needs to sort by. These are 'By Color', 'By Shape', 'By Size', 'By Shape and Color', 'By Shape and Size', 'By Color and Size', and 'By Shape, Color, and Size'.
